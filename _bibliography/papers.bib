abstract = {Only a few years after the implementation of the G-DRG (German Diagnosis Related Group) system physicians already began to complain of its negative effects on the quality of inpatient healthcare. The present study examines the recent experiences senior physicians have made with regard to the impact of the G-DRG system on the quality of healthcare and medical professionalism. Nine qualitative guided expert interviews were conducted focusing on the experiences of physicians in leading positions dealing with the G-DRG system in their everyday work. The interviewees report an intensification of work attributable to an increasing number of inpatient cases, a more lenient definition of medical indications and a reduction in patient retention time. The physicians interviewed have felt increasingly constrained by economic conditions. Additionally, they stated that the G-DRG system's incentive structure encourages the discrimination of older, care-dependent and multimorbid patients. Possible countermeasures include a political revision of incentive regulation as well as a strengthening of up-to-date professional ethical education and teaching.},

abstract = {Introduction: The deposition of amyloid beta (A$\beta$) within the brain is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its subsequent neurotoxic effects are widely believed to underlie AD pathogenesis. It has been shown by others that an acute treatment with A$\beta$(1-42) oligomers elicits immediate and long-lasting inhibitory effects on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in rodents. Hippocampal LTP is a form of synaptic plasticity that enables synaptic information storage and is closely connected to learning and memory. It depends on key neurotransmitter systems including the glutamatergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic system. To what extent the status quo of such neurotransmitters is disturbed in the early stages of A$\beta$-mediated pathophysiology is unclear. In this thesis, I used an animal model of the early pathogenesis of AD, in which healthy adult rats were treated once with an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) application of soluble A$\beta$(1-42) oligomers. I then explored whether changes in neurotransmitter receptor expression of the aforementioned systems become apparent after treatment. I also examined whether neuropathology is triggered within the rat hippocampus and associated brain structures. Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: (1) vehicle control group, (2) scrambled A$\beta$ control group and (3) A$\beta$(1-42) injected group. A single dose of the respective solution (5 ul) was administered into the lateral cerebral ventricles at seven to eight weeks of age. Frozen (30 um) brain sections of these animals underwent cresyl violet staining and immunohistochemical assessment, either one week (n=24) or six months (n=24) after treatment. Results: It was found that a single i.c.v. injection of A$\beta$(1-42) does not cause significant cell loss, or amyloid plaque deposition. A$\beta$-treatment caused acute microglial activation, however, that is attenuated in the long-term. In addition, astroglial hypofunction became manifest 6 months after A$\beta$-treatment. One week after A$\beta$ treatment, $\beta$1-adrenergic and dopamine D1-receptor expression was significantly decreased in the orbitofrontal cortex. Six months after A$\beta$-treatment, the expression of the GluN1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor was decreased in CA1 and the subiculum, whereas the expression of $\beta$2-adrenergic receptors was increased in the dentate gyrus and the entorhinal cortex. Discussion: These findings indicate that a solitary introduction of A$\beta$(1-42) into the brains of healthy young adult rats may suffice to trigger persistent Abeta-related changes in brain function. The resultant alterations of catecholaminergic and glutamatergic receptor expression as well as micro- and astroglia may contribute to the disturbance of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognition that has been described by others. These early changes in brain function may reflect subtle disbalances in brain homeostasis that emerge in the early pathogenesis of AD, and which cumulatively contribute to the disease profile.},

abstract = {Current classification systems for psychiatric disorders are pri- marly based on categorial typologies and describe these as distinct nosological entities. A dimensional perspective allows descriptions of a gradual transition between pathologies as well as between normality and pathologies of psychiatric symp - toms. Using acoustic hallucinations as most common form of perception disturbances as example, psychiatric-psychopatho- logical and theoretical pros and cons for a dimensional classi- fication of psychiatric symptomatology are sketched in this article. Although doubts concerning the similarity of real per- ceptions and acoustic hallucinations which underlie such men- tal events are controversially discussed, many hints could be found for a continuum of hallucinatoric symptoms from the mentally healthy population up to the group of patients with schizophrenia. Studies which investigate the neurophysiologi- cal mechanisms of acoustic hallucinations such as hearing voices in healthy persons in comparison to those in patients with schizophrenia could contribute to further differentiation.},
