abstract = {Only a few years after the implementation of the G-DRG (German Diagnosis Related Group) system physicians already began to complain of its negative effects on the quality of inpatient healthcare. The present study examines the recent experiences senior physicians have made with regard to the impact of the G-DRG system on the quality of healthcare and medical professionalism. Nine qualitative guided expert interviews were conducted focusing on the experiences of physicians in leading positions dealing with the G-DRG system in their everyday work. The interviewees report an intensification of work attributable to an increasing number of inpatient cases, a more lenient definition of medical indications and a reduction in patient retention time. The physicians interviewed have felt increasingly constrained by economic conditions. Additionally, they stated that the G-DRG system's incentive structure encourages the discrimination of older, care-dependent and multimorbid patients. Possible countermeasures include a political revision of incentive regulation as well as a strengthening of up-to-date professional ethical education and teaching.},

abstract = {Current classification systems for psychiatric disorders are pri- marly based on categorial typologies and describe these as distinct nosological entities. A dimensional perspective allows descriptions of a gradual transition between pathologies as well as between normality and pathologies of psychiatric symp - toms. Using acoustic hallucinations as most common form of perception disturbances as example, psychiatric-psychopatho- logical and theoretical pros and cons for a dimensional classi- fication of psychiatric symptomatology are sketched in this article. Although doubts concerning the similarity of real per- ceptions and acoustic hallucinations which underlie such men- tal events are controversially discussed, many hints could be found for a continuum of hallucinatoric symptoms from the mentally healthy population up to the group of patients with schizophrenia. Studies which investigate the neurophysiologi- cal mechanisms of acoustic hallucinations such as hearing voices in healthy persons in comparison to those in patients with schizophrenia could contribute to further differentiation.},
