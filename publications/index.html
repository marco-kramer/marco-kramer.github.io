Despite the risk of dependency and serious adverse events, they are increasingly prescribed to outpatients. Yet little is known about the prescription to inpatients. In this article, we analyze the BZD and ZD prescription patterns in the routine data of 913 psychiatric and somatic inpatients treated in Bochum, Germany. BZD were prescribed more often as regular medication in psychiatry and ZD in somatic hospitals. ZD were more often used on demand, by female patients, and combined with other substances. Both were frequently prescribed to older adults, especially as part of somatic treatment and in combination with opioids. Prescription of sedative hypnotics is frequent in psychiatric and somatic inpatients. Their use seems to be partially independent of recorded psychiatric indications.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Kramer2022a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Acute and chronic effects of amyloid beta on neuropathology and neurotransmitter receptor expression in the rodent hippocampus and associated areas</div> <div class="author"> <em>Kramer, Marco</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> 2022 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Introduction: The deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) within the brain is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Its subsequent neurotoxic effects are widely believed to underlie AD pathogenesis. It has been shown by others that an acute treatment with Aβ(1-42) oligomers elicits immediate and long-lasting inhibitory effects on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in rodents. Hippocampal LTP is a form of synaptic plasticity that enables synaptic information storage and is closely connected to learning and memory. It depends on key neurotransmitter systems including the glutamatergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic system. To what extent the status quo of such neurotransmitters is disturbed in the early stages of Aβ-mediated pathophysiology is unclear. In this thesis, I used an animal model of the early pathogenesis of AD, in which healthy adult rats were treated once with an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) application of soluble Aβ(1-42) oligomers. I then explored whether changes in neurotransmitter receptor expression of the aforementioned systems become apparent after treatment. I also examined whether neuropathology is triggered within the rat hippocampus and associated brain structures. Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: (1) vehicle control group, (2) scrambled Aβcontrol group and (3) Aβ(1-42) injected group. A single dose of the respective solution (5 ul) was administered into the lateral cerebral ventricles at seven to eight weeks of age. Frozen (30 um) brain sections of these animals underwent cresyl violet staining and immunohistochemical assessment, either one week (n=24) or six months (n=24) after treatment. Results: It was found that a single i.c.v. injection of Aβ(1-42) does not cause significant cell loss, or amyloid plaque deposition. Aβ-treatment caused acute microglial activation, however, that is attenuated in the long-term. In addition, astroglial hypofunction became manifest 6 months after Aβ-treatment. One week after Aβtreatment, \beta1-adrenergic and dopamine D1-receptor expression was significantly decreased in the orbitofrontal cortex. Six months after Aβ-treatment, the expression of the GluN1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor was decreased in CA1 and the subiculum, whereas the expression of \beta2-adrenergic receptors was increased in the dentate gyrus and the entorhinal cortex. Discussion: These findings indicate that a solitary introduction of Aβ(1-42) into the brains of healthy young adult rats may suffice to trigger persistent Abeta-related changes in brain function. The resultant alterations of catecholaminergic and glutamatergic receptor expression as well as micro- and astroglia may contribute to the disturbance of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognition that has been described by others. These early changes in brain function may reflect subtle disbalances in brain homeostasis that emerge in the early pathogenesis of AD, and which cumulatively contribute to the disease profile.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Kramer2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">[Psychopathology and Theory of Perceptual Disturbances]</div> <div class="author"> <em>Kramer, Marco</em>, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Juckel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juckel, Georg</a>, and Mavrogiorgou, Paraskevi </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Fortschritte der Neurologie Psychiatrie</em> 2022 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>[Article in German language] Current classification systems for psychiatric disorders are pri- marly based on categorial typologies and describe these as distinct nosological entities. A dimensional perspective allows descriptions of a gradual transition between pathologies as well as between normality and pathologies of psychiatric symp - toms. Using acoustic hallucinations as most common form of perception disturbances as example, psychiatric-psychopatho- logical and theoretical pros and cons for a dimensional classi- fication of psychiatric symptomatology are sketched in this article. Although doubts concerning the similarity of real per- ceptions and acoustic hallucinations which underlie such men- tal events are controversially discussed, many hints could be found for a continuum of hallucinatoric symptoms from the mentally healthy population up to the group of patients with schizophrenia. Studies which investigate the neurophysiologi- cal mechanisms of acoustic hallucinations such as hearing voices in healthy persons in comparison to those in patients with schizophrenia could contribute to further differentiation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Kramer2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Context and Mood Effects in Interpreting Ambiguous Facial Expressions</div> <div class="author"> <em>Kramer, Marco</em>, Heinisch, Christine, Baumgart, Patrick, Brüne, Martin, and <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Juckel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juckel, Georg</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2022 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Dear Editor,We have recently read that the typical bias toward a negative valence in the classification of ambiguous facial expressions shifts toward positivity through mindfulness interventions (H...</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Knoll2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"> ["Something humane has been lost".

The present study examines the recent experiences senior physicians have made with regard to the impact of the G-DRG system on the quality of healthcare and medical professionalism. Nine qualitative guided expert interviews were conducted focusing on the experiences of physicians in leading positions dealing with the G-DRG system in their everyday work. The interviewees report an intensification of work attributable to an increasing number of inpatient cases, a more lenient definition of medical indications and a reduction in patient retention time. The physicians interviewed have felt increasingly constrained by economic conditions. Additionally, they stated that the G-DRG system’s incentive structure encourages the discrimination of older, care-dependent and multimorbid patients. Possible countermeasures include a political revision of incentive regulation as well as a strengthening of up-to-date professional ethical education and teaching.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Gather2017" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effects of open-door policies in acute psychiatry on (perceived) coercion, serious incidents and absconding – a qualitative empirical interview study.</div> <div class="author">Gather, Jakov, Kalagi, Janice, Bernard, Johannes, <u>Knoll, Marco</u>, Otte, Ina, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Juckel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juckel, Georg</a>, and <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jochen_Vollmann" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vollmann, Jochen</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Violence in clinical psychiatry: Proceedings of the 10th European Congress on Violence in Clinical Psychiatry</em> Apr 2017 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Recent court rulings in Germany raised the judicial threshold for coercion in psychiatry which has prompted changes in the law at federal and federal state level. An “open psychiatry” aims to reduce (perceived) coercion by treating patients in open rather than closed wards. Open-door policies in acute psychiatry are controversial, and the concern is often expressed that open-door policies will lead to absconding and that absconding increases the risk of harm to self or others. On the other hand, closed doors may result in higher tension on the ward and consequently more aggressive incidents within the clinic. This qualitative empirical interview study explores how service users, nurses and doctors experience and view open-door policies and their effects when it comes to patient well-being and the security of patients, employees and society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2023 .
