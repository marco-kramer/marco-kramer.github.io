<p>Over the last decades, a crisis of the neurobiological research paradigm in psychiatry has become evident, which goes along with a questionable diagnostic validity and marginal therapeutic benefits. Especially in the case of schizophrenia as quintessential mental disorder, the severe burden of disease has kept growing and long-term outcomes have not improved throughout the last decades. It is proposed that one of the underlying issues is the neglicence of psychopathology and its research. Also, in clinical settings it is often reduced to the application of highly standardized diagnostic manuals. </p>
<p>Taking ideas from the phenomenological psychopathology as our starting point, we hypothesize that difficulties of schizophrenic individuals in interacting with the ordinary lifeworld are causally connected to the emergence and maintenance of this devastating mental disorder. The concept of lifeworld comprises both our natural, spatiotemporal lifeworld and our culturally determined life-world with its unquestioned premises, its subjective stores of knowledge, its modes of self- and time-experience and intersubjectivity.</p>
<p>In order to shed light on differences and potential mechanisms within these domains, we developed a mixed-methods design comprising qualitative interviews, iterative go-alongs, questionnaires, computer-assisted analysis of social interaction and exposure to virtual reality.</p>
